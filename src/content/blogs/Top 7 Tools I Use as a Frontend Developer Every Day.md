Let's be honest - programming without tools isn't exactly fun. You're constantly juggling between writing your code, fixing bugs, and trying to prevent yourself from going berserk and slamming the table. And especially if you're working on frontend projects, even the smallest task can feel tedious if you don't have the right tools in place.

Trust me, I was in your place once. Grinding through the code, jotting down snippets from StackOverflow, and typing 100 lines of code for a fancy component, and 1000 lines for its styling. Overtime, I came across certain tools and extensions that not only makes the mundane tasks bearable, but genuinely enjoyable.

So here it is — **a quick list of the 7 tools and extensions I use almost every day as a frontend developer**:

## Styling

### Tailwind CSS
My favourite CSS-utility framework, Tailwind has been game changing for me since I started using it in early 2024. Extremely ease-to-use, Tailwind makes sure I don't need to name each of my divs and sections and still get the styling done. Moreover, its mobile-first breakpoint system means I don't have to separately style for the mobile screens.

Pro tip: Never back down from using Tailwind CSS just because the "tags look long and complicated".

### Figma
I'm a big fan of logos, especially designing logos with fonts and color gradients. But sometimes I want to design a wireframe for my website before I get my hands dirty.  
Either way, I turn to Figma.

Figma is an interface designing tool excelling in creating mockups and products with minimal effort. Drag-and-drop functionality, FigJam, and plugins boost its already star-studded reputation.

## Libraries

### Shadcn/UI
Built on Tailwind, has most of the necessary components, download-and-import approach. Need I say more?

Shadcn is component library, i.e., it has components already prepared and ready to be downloaded and used. It significantly reduces time required to build them from scratch, and the variety of components ensure that the user never returns empty-handed.

### Lucide.dev
We talked about components ready to be downloaded, but what about icons? Where would you get the GitHub, Instagram, LinkedIn, StackOverflow icons that are essential in your websites? Step forward — Lucide.

Lucide boasts an astounding number of icons that can be downloaded as SVG, PNG, or copied as components in JSX, Vue, Svelte, and Angular. The go-to website for icons, Lucide shows no intention of stepping aside from my portfolio.

## Extensions

### Error Lens
Cometh the hour, cometh the GOATed extension. Error Lens has saved me multiple *hours* in finding errors and mistakes.  
And the best part? It works with Python, C, C++, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js, Astro- \*pant* \*pant*.

Don't sleep on this extension, it's probably the one helping my "Time Management" skill the most.

### Prettier Formatter
Starting my coding journey with Python, I've always been picky with my code being properly indented. Prettier has helped me auto-format my code to keep it clean and visually attractive.

### Live Preview
Much like Live Server, Live Preview was essential when I worked with plain HTML/CSS/JS files. I could open the website by splitting my VSCode screen with this extension and see all the changes affect the website in real-time.

Seeing its stocks diminish after switching to React, Next, and Astro, Live Preview made a small comeback with its ability to show markdown files with all the headings and links embedded.
