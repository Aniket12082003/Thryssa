*“Engineers like to solve problems. If there are no problems handily available, they will create their own problems.”* — Scott Adams

My decision to pursue web development aligns more with the latter part of the quote — the first sentence had little to do with my college experience. All I learned in college was how **not** to approach a problem, and which fields I was definitely not made for.

## Humble Beginnings

I started my college journey in 2021. Techno India University, albeit not the most popular institution, promised top-notch education, unparalleled help from faculty members, healthy competition from peers, and renowned placement prowess.  
*(Spoiler alert — I was unable to see any of those promises materialize.)*

### Healthy "Competition"...???

From the get-go, I found a massive flaw among my peers — most of them were extremely laid-back when it came to academics. Don't get me wrong, there were incredibly talented and goal-driven individuals in my class, but they were the minority in an 80-student classroom. As a result, slumps and bunks during class hours became so frequent that teachers barely managed to muster 40% attendance, even in core subjects.

Unfortunately, my initial friend group embraced this laid-back approach. We frequently bunked classes to eat out, watch movies, and waste time. Unknowingly, I delayed my breakthrough, scraped by with a CGPA over 8, and developed an unhealthy habit of procrastination. On top of that, two early scandals (neither of which I was directly involved in) made it difficult for me to connect with the group going forward.

My life wasn't exactly monotonous, but it definitely wasn’t positive either.

### The Nerd Group

As second year rolled in, I slowly realized the mess I was stuck in. I had to get my act together and go through a much-needed academic revamp if I was to have any hope of redemption.

My first big step was cutting off from my initial group. I started spending more time attending lectures and taking notes. Eventually, I was purposefully excluded from numerous outings — which, honestly, was not a problem at all.

Now, I’ve never been someone who fits effortlessly into any group, but **"THE BOYS"** group (yes, that was the actual name) was a welcome change. The group consisted of five distinguished gentlemen (I was the sixth) who preferred paying attention in class, completing assignments well before deadlines, and spending their free time playing football. This was the group I was looking for — and, over time, I realized it was the group I needed.

Once I officially joined the group, I noticed a shift in how others perceived me. I wasn’t just another student anymore — I became the person people turned to for assignments, doubt-clearing, and last-minute exam prep. It felt like a new responsibility had been thrown onto me — *"help us through this course."*

## Enter — "Web Dev"

Third year arrived with a pleasant surprise — the subject *Web Development*. Until then, I had no interest in pursuing any subject as my future domain.  
C/C++? Boring.  
Computer Architecture? Monotonous.  
Machine Learning? Complicated.  
Automata? Jargon.  
Web Development, though, was **different**.

When the practical classes began, I was surprised at how comfortable I felt with HTML and CSS. While most of the class was studying just to pass, I found myself tinkering with HTML tags and CSS styles. It was addictive — like a switch had been flicked on inside my brain.

My groupmates were deep into ML and Java Spring Boot and thought web dev was pointless — but not me. I had made up my mind. This would be **my domain**.

### Grid or Flex?

My entire 5th semester was spent learning basic HTML tags and CSS properties. I spent countless hours building components like accordions, cards, and testimonials — each one sharpening my frontend skills. Slowly and steadily, by the end of the semester, I had successfully built my first website (as part of an assignment), utilizing most of what I had learned.

The 6th semester was all about building more and more websites. Some were incomplete, some were complete but not up to standard, and some remained only as ideas. But every project helped me understand and get familiar with important CSS properties and layout patterns.  
However, somewhere along the line, my growth began to stagnate.  
It was time for a last-minute push.

## Crown Comes Calling!

### Exhibition for Inhibition

Just before my final year, the college organized an intra-college ML Hackathon/Exhibition for 3rd and 4th-year students. I, a newbie, decided to participate with a team of fellow beginners.  
*(Spoiler alert: It went horribly.)*

When we reached the venue, it was immediately clear that we were underprepared. I was nowhere near the frontend level that others had showcased. 3D models, animation triggers, stunning UI — our barebones bike value prediction model (built using just HTML and CSS) was arguably the weakest entry in the hackathon.

We returned with our heads down.

All was not lost, though.

### Gear Up, It's Time

I took valuable insights from that hackathon and got serious about leveling up. It was time to learn a proper JavaScript framework — and I chose React.

Learning React was a **grind**.

For the first few weeks, I focused on routing, creating components, and integrating TailwindCSS. But then came the hooks — and they had *other plans*.

- `useState` took a week to truly grasp  
- `useEffect` took a week and a half  
- `useNavigation` took just 15 minutes  
- And I still haven’t wrapped my head around `useRef`

Despite the struggle, hooks paved the way for more efficient development. I now use `useState` nearly every time I need dynamic, changing state in my apps.

### React Done — Now Next?

January 2025 marked the beginning of my post-React phase. I had joined a mentorship program, where I was tasked with learning Next.js — especially SSR/CSR concepts — and other real-world tools.

The start was smooth, but over time I became overly reliant on client-side rendering. I couldn’t use hooks the way I wanted, and on top of that, I had to integrate Payload CMS into my personal blog project.

Still, I pushed through.

Somehow, I managed to learn Next.js — and that was the moment everything changed. I could now implement MongoDB, NextAuth.js, and other tools seamlessly within Next.js, without worrying much about backend issues. I was slowly becoming a capable fullstack developer.

## Shooting for the Stars (and Astro)

Now that my B.Tech journey is effectively coming to an end, I’ve started working with Astro.js to create my portfolio, and using Astro + MongoDB to build this very blog site. I plan to keep pushing forward in the world of web development — creating meaningful websites that actually make a difference.

Whether you're a struggling B.Tech student, a hobbyist, or just someone trying to find their place in tech — know that it’s okay to start late, fail early, and still find your path. Web development gave me direction, and it might just do the same for you.

That’s about it — the story of how I went from just another B.Tech student to a frontend (and slowly fullstack) developer. This is my journey, and I hope you’ve taken something valuable away from it.

**Until next time!**
