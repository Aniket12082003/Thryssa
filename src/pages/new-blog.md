Creating an Astro blog website isn't easy. You have to learn new techniques, new language (astro), and certainly new way of writing codes. I swear I'll never see hyphens the same way after this.

However, despite everything, Astro still remains my top pic for creating a blog website. Extremely fast, easy to code, and mdx support make up for its initial intimidating .astro file structure.
